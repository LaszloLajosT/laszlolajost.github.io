## An example for documentation in python projects

```python
# Compute the volume of a brick, given its dimentions
# Compute the base area from the width and length


# Input: the width, a positive float in any distance unit
width = 2

# Input: the length, a positive float in the same unit
length = 3

area = width * length
print('The base area is', area)

# Compute the volume from the base area and height

# Input: the height, a positive float in the same unit
height = 4

# Output: the volume, in cubic distance units
volume = area * height
print('The volume is', volume)


```
